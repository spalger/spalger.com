You could call me a linter addict. I can get a bit harsh when it comes to using proper style and keeping things consistent, and I tend to lean on my linters about as heavy as I'm leaning on spell checking right now. For this reason, me and jshint have become pretty good friends since until a few months ago it was the *only* reasonable tool available.

When I first gave gulp a shot though, the gulp-jshint didn't have all of the features that I expected, so I got my fork warmed up and started submitting pulls. Before long I was taking over maintenance of the project as I had basically re-written it.

Thankfully, it's quite small and doesn't require much attention.

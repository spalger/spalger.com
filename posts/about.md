title: About

So... Iâ€™m a web developer and gadget fanatic who digs JavaScript, Apple, and a bunch of other things. To understand my current interests I suggest checking out my blog.

I work at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co), and primarily focus on the [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) project. I also am an avid reader of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and [echo.js](http://www.echojs.com/).

You can find me on Twitter [@spalger](https://twitter.com/spalger) or collaborate with me on my open source projects on Github [@spalger](https://github.com/spalger).
